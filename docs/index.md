**NOTE:** Our login instructions have recently changed. We will now be requiring Duo Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for login to LCRC clusters. Please follow our updated instructions below.

# Getting Started in LCRC

If you are looking to get access to LCRC for the first time, see below for either [Argonne Employees](account-project-management/accounts-and-access.md#for-current-argonne-employees) or [Non-Employees/Outside Collaborators](account-project-management/accounts-and-access.md#for-non-employeesoutside-collaborators). If you need to [extend or reactivate](account-project-management/accounts-and-access.md#extend-or-reactivate-collaborator-accounts) your Argonne Collaborator account or if your [Argonne username has changed](account-project-management/accounts-and-access.md#changes-to-your-argonne-username), please find information below as well. To access LCRC resources, you need to complete 4 tasks at a minimum:

1. [**Get an Argonne Domain or Collaborator Account**](account-project-management/accounts-and-access.md)
2. [**Join an LCRC Project**](account-project-management/project-management.md#join-an-existing-lcrc-project)
3. **[Enroll in Duo MFA](account-project-management/mfa.md)**
4. **[Set Up an SSH Connection](account-project-management/ssh.md)**

Until **ALL** of these steps are completed, you will not be able to login to LCRC resources.

Once you have setup your account, you should be able to access the resource of your choice by following our system documentation.

If you have any questions related to your Argonne account or Argonne Collaborator account status or if you need a password reset, please send email to [help@anl.gov](mailto:help@anl.gov) or call the Argonne Service Desk at (630) 252-9999. LCRC support staff does not have access to this information directly.
