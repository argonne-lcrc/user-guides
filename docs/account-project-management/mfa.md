*NOTE*: LCRC Duo Enrollment will begin on **August 19, 2024**. Please revisit this page on or after that time.
To ensure your device is compatible, you can try installing the Duo Mobile App in advance.

# Enrolling in Duo MFA

After you have [joined the **lcrc** project or a sub-project of LCRC](../project-management/#join-an-existing-lcrc-project) (current LCRC users should already be in a project), you will be required to enroll in the CELS Duo MFA system on your next login to the [LCRC Accounts System](https://accounts.lcrc.anl.gov). If you are already logged in, you can logout and log back in to complete the setup right away.

*Note*: If you cannot install the Duo Mobile App, please first verify that your device OS is up to date. You can also reference the [Duo help documentation](https://help.duo.com) for a list of compatibile devices and versions. If you still cannot install the Duo Mobile App because your device cannot be updated, is not compatible, or you do not have a Smartphone/Tablet, please contact [support@lcrc.anl.gov](mailto:support@lcrc.anl.gov).

1. Login to [https://accounts.lcrc.anl.gov](https://accounts.lcrc.anl.gov) with your Argonne Domain or Argonne Collaborator account username and password.

2. You should be prompted to configure Duo MFA. Select the device type you want to register for Duo.
