# LCRC User Account Overview

If you are looking to get access to LCRC for the first time, see below for either [Argonne Employees](http://www.lcrc.anl.gov/for-users/getting-started/getting-an-account/#argonne) or [Non-Employees/Outside Collaborators](http://www.lcrc.anl.gov/for-users/getting-started/getting-an-account/#nonargonne). If you need to [extend or reactivate](http://www.lcrc.anl.gov/for-users/getting-started/getting-an-account/#reactivate) your Argonne Collaborator account or if your [Argonne username has changed](http://www.lcrc.anl.gov/for-users/getting-started/getting-an-account/#usernamechange), please find information below as well. To access LCRC resources, you need to complete 3 tasks at a minimum: 

1. **Get an Argonne Domain or Collaborator Account**
2. **Join an LCRC Project**
3. **[Set Up an SSH Connection](https://www.lcrc.anl.gov/for-users/getting-started/ssh/)** 

All of these steps are outlined below or links to more information are provided. 

Until **ALL** of these steps are completed, you will not be able to login to LCRC resources.

If you have any questions related to your Argonne account or Argonne Collaborator account status or if you need a password reset, please send email to [help@anl.gov](mailto:help@anl.gov) or call the Argonne Service Desk at (630) 252-9999. LCRC support staff does not have access to this information directly.

### For Current Argonne Employees

Argonne employees should already have an Argonne Domain account. If you’ve got an active badge, you likely have an account, and are entitled to one if you don’t already have one. It’s the same account you use to login to your Argonne e-mail account and other Argonne apps. If you are an Argonne employee and either don't have an Argonne Domain account or have forgotten your Argonne username or password, please contact [help@anl.gov](mailto:help@anl.gov) or call the Argonne Service Desk at (630) 252-9999. LCRC support cannot address issues directly with your Argonne account. To gain access to the LCRC clusters, please login to [https://accounts.lcrc.anl.gov](https://accounts.lcrc.anl.gov) using your Argonne username and password. Once logged in, on the left hand side, click on the **Join Project** link.

![](https://www.lcrc.anl.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2022/08/Join-Project-2022.png) 

You should now search for the **_lcrc_** project.

Below the search box, the list of projects will update to show only the _lcrc_ project. Click on the _lcrc_ project name below followed by the **Request Membership** button. 

![Request Membership](https://www.lcrc.anl.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2020/05/Request-Membership.png)

As an Argonne employee, membership to the _lcrc_ project will be granted instantaneously. Note: Any other projects you may request membership for outside of the lcrc project will require approval by the project owner. Your account should now be automatically created and activated for LCRC access including a home directory on the LCRC clusters. You will also be granted your [startup allocation](https://www.lcrc.anl.gov/for-users/getting-started/projects-in-lcrc/#startupprojs). You will receive an email letting you know that your LCRC access has been granted. The last step will be adding a public SSH key. You can find information on how to do this here: [Logging In and SSH Keys](../ssh/). Once you've added an SSH key, you should be able to login to the LCRC clusters.

### For Non-Employees/Outside Collaborators

Non-Argonne employees and outside collaborators will need an _Argonne Collaborator account_. The link to apply for an Argonne Collaborator account is at [https://apps.anl.gov/registration/collaborators](https://apps.anl.gov/registration/collaborators) and is accessible from anywhere. You will need to use the official Argonne e-mail address of your Argonne sponsor to be able to request an account. Your sponsor must be an Argonne employee. These Argonne Collaborator accounts are annual and can be [renewed by the sponsor each year](http://www.lcrc.anl.gov/for-users/getting-started/getting-an-account/#reactivate). Additional information will be required and a wait time may occur for non-US citizens before an account is approved. Once your sponsor approves your Argonne Collaborator account and it is created, you should receive an email. There **WILL** be a period from when your sponsor approves the account to the actual creation of the account. If you are the Argonne sponsor of the account, log in to [Cyber Gate Pass](https://apps.inside.anl.gov/cgp) to check the status of the account. To actually gain access to the LCRC clusters, you **MUST** join an existing LCRC project using your new Argonne account. Please work with your Argonne sponsor and they should indicate what project to join. If you know the project you should join, please login to [https://accounts.lcrc.anl.gov](https://accounts.lcrc.anl.gov) using your Argonne Collaborator username and password. Once logged in, on the left hand side bar, click on the **Join Project** link. 

![](https://www.lcrc.anl.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2022/08/Join-Project-2022.png) 

You should now search for the project name indicated by your Argonne sponsor. 

![](https://www.lcrc.anl.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2022/08/Join-Project-Search-Other.png)

Below the search box, the list of projects will update to show only the project named you've indicated. Click on the project name below followed by the **Request Membership** button.

![Request Membership](https://www.lcrc.anl.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2020/05/Request-Membership.png)

Your sponsor or the project owner will need to also approve this request. When your project access is granted by the project owner, you will also be automatically added to the _lcrc_ project. Your account will now be automatically created and activated for LCRC access including a home directory on the LCRC clusters. The last step will be adding a public SSH key. You can find information on how to do this here: [Logging In and SSH Keys](../ssh/). Once you've added an SSH key, you should be able to login to the LCRC clusters.

### Extend or Reactivate Collaborator Accounts

When an outside collaborator's computer account is:

*   **Set to expire soon:**
    *   If you are the user of the account, simply contact your Argonne sponsor and ask them to extend the account by following the next paragraph.
    *   If you are the Argonne sponsor of the account, have your division HR representative log in to Workday and update the contingent worker contract end date for your outside collaborator and check that the job profile is "Outside Collaborator."
*   **Already expired:**
    *   If you are the user of the account, log in to [Argonne Collaborator Registration page](https://apps.anl.gov/registration/collaborators) and follow the instructions. You can technically select a different username at the time of re-registration, but it will default back to the original username from the first registration automatically. Please make sure to use the existing username in order to access your previous LCRC data!
    *   If you are the Argonne sponsor of the account, log in to [Cyber Gate Pass](https://apps.inside.anl.gov/cgp) to Invite the outside collaborator to re-register; the outside collaborator will receive an email with the link to the Argonne Collaborator Registration website to re-register. Although the outside collaborator can technically select a different username at the time of re-registration, it will default back to the original username from the first registration automatically. Please make sure they use the existing username in order to access their previous LCRC data!

### Continuing LCRC Access After Your Argonne Appointment Ends

If you are transitioning from an Argonne appointment to external collaborator, after your appointment ends, you will need to apply for an [Argonne Collaborator account](https://apps.anl.gov/registration/collaborators) if you wish to keep your access. You will need to use the official Argonne e-mail address of your Argonne sponsor when applying for the account. You **cannot** apply for the Argonne collaborator account while your Argonne appointment is current. Once your appointment expires you can then apply right away. After your Argonne Collaborator account has been **approved and created** simply contact [LCRC support via email](mailto:support@lcrc.anl.gov). Send us your old and new usernames and we will convert your username on our end. If you received your collaborator account within 90 days of your Argonne appointment and account expiring, you will still have access to your old account data.

### When Your Argonne Username Has Changed

If your Argonne username has changed or your domain account becomes a collaborator account or vice versa, simply contact [LCRC support via email](mailto:support@lcrc.anl.gov). Send us your old and new usernames and we will convert your username on our end.
