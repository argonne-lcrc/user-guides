## Managing Argonne Collaborator Accounts

---

### Extend or Reactivate Collaborator Accounts

**If an account is set to expire soon**:

  - **Users**: Contact your Argonne sponsor to request an extension.
  - **Argonne Sponsors**: Have your division HR representative update the end date in Workday and ensure the job profile is "Outside Collaborator."

**If an account has already expired**:

  - **Users**: Re-register at [Argonne Collaborator Registration page](https://apps.anl.gov/registration/collaborators) using your existing username to retain access to previous data.
  - **Argonne Sponsors**: Invite the collaborator to re-register via [Cyber Gate Pass](https://apps.inside.anl.gov/cgp), and ensure they use their original username for continuity.

---

### LCRC Access Post-Argonne Appointment

**Transitioning to an External Collaborator**:

  - Apply for an [Argonne Collaborator account](https://apps.anl.gov/registration/collaborators) using your sponsor's Argonne email address after your appointment ends.
  - Cannot apply while the current Argonne appointment is active.
  - If approved within 90 days of appointment expiration, contact [LCRC support](mailto:support@lcrc.anl.gov) with old and new usernames for assistance in data access.
