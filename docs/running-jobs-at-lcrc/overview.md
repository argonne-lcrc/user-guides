# Running Jobs at LCRC

LCRC has five high-performance computing clusters: Bebop, Swing, Chrysalis, Crossover, and the latest addition, Improv. These clusters are designed to cater to a wide range of computational needs and research projects.

To effectively manage and schedule computational tasks, LCRC employs two advanced job scheduling systems:

- **Slurm**: This is the scheduling system for Bebop, Swing, Chrysalis, and Crossover clusters.
- **PBS Professional**: With an eye towards future alignment with the ALCF, LCRC has adopted PBS Pro for the Improv cluster.

For detailed guidelines on utilizing these systems, please refer to the following resources:
