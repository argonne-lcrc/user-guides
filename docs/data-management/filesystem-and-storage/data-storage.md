## Tape Storage

LCRC operates a 700. We are currently running a combination of LTO6 and LTO8 tape technology. The LTO tape drives have built-in hardware compression which typically achieve compression ratios between 1.25:1 and 2:1 depending on the data yielding an effective capacity of approximately 65PB.
