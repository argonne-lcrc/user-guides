# LCRC User Guides

_(Below Matt proposes a format for common tasks and documentation to be added on to as needed)_

## 1. Common Tasks

### a. Content Updates 

#### i. LCRC Regular Updates
When adding .md files to User docs or adding left sidebar sub-navigation, the LCRC team can make most updates to User doc or Drupal site without submitting approvals to Sandbox or making Sandbox aware this work is going on. 

**Making Regular Updates**
-	LCRC modifying, deleting, creating markdown docs within existing menus
-	And/or LCRC creating new folders within the structure
-	Merging Dev branch to Main 
- Docs.lcrc.anl.gov site will reflect changes immediately

#### ii. LCRC Special Updates
Sandbox edits drop down menus in the User doc, LCRC does not. Certain edits LCRC makes to Drupal site top nav or to the top level of the User Doc left sidebar nav will leave the User doc top nav a mismatch. We want to ensure drop down menus and User Doc left sidebar nav always match. 

**To ensure all menus match, LCRC should contact SBX in specific instances**
-  When changes are made to the top level of Docs left sidebar navigation
-  When changes are made to the Drupal drop down menu

This request can be made by submitting approval requests or by emailing SBX directly to let SBX know work is needed. Expect at least 24 hours for Sandbox to put the edit in place. 

In turn, Sandbox will perform the following work: 

**SBX updates the User Doc drop-down menus**
-	SBX makes the updates, confirms User doc and Drupal site menus are in synch
-	SBX compiles the files before committing
-	SBX creates pull request for approval
-	LCRC merges Dev branch to Main 
- Live docs site will be cached, changes may be delayed, require a hard refresh
