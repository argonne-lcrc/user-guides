The PI must be a current Argonne employee.</li> <li>The project request is sent to the LCRC Allocations Administrator and to the LCRC Allocations Committee.</li> <li>The committee's decision is reported via email to the project requester.</li> <li>If the project has been approved, the mail will include the number of hours allocated to the project. This number may be different from what was requested. This number may also be some initial allocation that will subsequently be augmented based on decisions by the LCRC Allocations Committee.</li> <li>As a part of creating the project, someone on the LCRC Allocations Committee will be affiliated with the project as a Point of Contact (PoC). That person will be the project's contact on the committee. They are expected to become moderately familiar with the project, to act as the project's advocate if necessary, and to be able to explain the project and the project's status to the committee.</li> <li>Every fiscal quarter starting October 1, all projects will have their allocations zeroed out and be restarted with new allocations as requested and approved. This will be done in order to adjust and balance the use of the system. Unused time does not carry over to the next quarter.</li> <li>When making quarterly decisions, the Allocations Committee PoC will look at the usage for the previous quarter and may query any projects that have not been using most of their time to learn what their plan is for the next quarter. Sometimes they also query projects that have used a lot of time for their future plans.</li> <li>Once the project has been created, PIs can add other users to the project, appoint Proxies (or Co-PIs), and administer the project's allocation.</li> <li>In advance of the annual October (Argonne's new fiscal year) re-allocation, PIs will be reminded to send in a request for the next year's allocation for their project.</li> <li>Also in advance of the annual October re-allocation, PIs will also be required to provide a report on their project at that time. If reports had been sent in for previous quarters, those will be sufficient, if they are current. The basic goal here is to get at least one annual report for each project. This report will be used to help describe the overall use of the systems and will also be used when deciding on annual allocations for all projects. The format of the report will be roughly 2-3 pages long, with pictures highly encouraged. Projects that do not submit a report will not receive any new time for the new fiscal year until a report is received.</li> <li>LCRC allocations granted each quarter use Argonne's fiscal calendar.

For large requests, justification for the typical number of nodes per case should be provided based on scaling studies. A large request is typically at or above 4000 node-hours on Improv, 14000 node-hours on Bebop and 120 GPU node-hours on Swing. (For select cases, PIs may be requested to provide scaling results for requests below these limits as well).</p> <p>Please follow the instructions below the \"Request Allocation\" subsection on the LCRC Accounts page when creating or updating a project to complete the allocation request. Please review the sample project report in the link provided below the \"Request allocation\" box on the allocation page (sections \"Experiments planned &amp; size of calculations\" and \"Large allocation efficiency\"). Please do not submit one-line requests stating request is based on past experience/usage. The allocation committee does not have access to this information. Such requests will be considered incomplete and ineligible for review.</p> <p>The strong scaling study is required to justify the choice of the number of nodes used to compute the node-hour request. Please present the scaling studies in text form in the \"Request allocation\" box as shown in the screenshot in the example link. Do not attach separate .doc/png/pdf files to your allocation request. A publication which shows scaling on an old machine on a different problem does not qualify as a scaling study. It can be used as a basis for the scaling study, though. The scaling study has to justify the use of the nodes to be used in the problem described in the allocation request and conducted on LCRC clusters. New projects can be granted a small initial allocation to complete the scaling study, if required.</p> <p>Request for time on all partitions (Bebop, Improv, Swing) should be in node-hours. The node-hour computations shown in the \"Request allocation\" box should match the node hours requested for each of the partitions. Please present your node-hour computations in the format shown in the sample allocation request. Providing incomplete/inaccurate or unclear information can delay the decision with regard to your allocation request or lead to a reduction in your requested allocation. PIs might not be granted their full allocation request. Allocations grants are made by the allocation committee after considering various factors such as the total time available versus the total requests from PIs across the lab, past usage of the PI/project and the computational readiness of the project.</p> <p>Projects that have exhausted their initial quarterly allocation should use the backfill queue.  The backfill queue can be used only when the project has a negative balance.  Limited mid-quarter allocations are granted for new projects.  Mid-quarter allocation requests are reviewed once a week (Tuesday). PIs should budget at least one week for a response/decision on their allocation request - longer if the request is inaccurate/incomplete/unclear and does not follow the guidelines provided in the sample project request document. The maximum mid-quarter allocation request will be as follows: 2,000 node-hours on Improv, 7,000 node-hours on Bebop, 25 GPU node-hours on Swing. This amount is pro-rated based on the time remaining in the quarter.</p> <p>No allocations are made within two weeks before the quarter's end.  Project renewals are at the start of the fiscal year. Failing to renew before the allocation deadline results in the project being ineligible for allocation in Q1 (PIs/users in this project can run in backfill during this time). Projects not renewed at the start of the fiscal year can also have a reduced allocation from Q2-Q4.</p> <p>PIs who expect to use time for all the remaining quarters for a given allocation year (extending from October to September) should enter an allocation request for all quarters. If a PI has applied for time for only a single quarter, they will not automatically be granted allocations for the next quarter(s). A new request will be needed and the project will have to run in the backfill queue in the quarter in which the new request was made.</p> <p>All unused time at the end of the quarter is lost - they cannot be transferred to the next/later quarters.   Time granted on a given partition cannot be transferred/switched to another partition (except in cases where a software does not run due to system/software stack changes).</p> <p>PIs who request &gt; 15000 node-hours per quarter over all projects (Bebop/Improv) and 120 node-hours per quarter over all projects (Swing) will be required to provide a \"transition plan\" detailing how they plan to transition their work-loads to larger DoE clusters such as ALCF/NERSC or other national platforms supported by DoE for large computational projects.  PIs requiring large allocations should supplement their LCRC allocations with other computational resources (ALCF/NERSC or other national platforms supported by the program offices).</p>"},{"location":"best-practices-and-policies/best-practices-and-policies-overview/","title":"Best Practices and Policies Overview","text":""},{"location":"best-practices-and-policies/best-practices-and-policies-overview/#monthly-maintenance-day","title":"Monthly Maintenance Day","text":""},{"location":"best-practices-and-policies/best-practices-and-policies-overview/#allocation-expiration-policy","title":"Allocation Expiration Policy","text":""},{"location":"best-practices-and-policies/best-practices-and-policies-overview/#cybersecurity-policy","title":"Cybersecurity Policy","text":""},{"location":"best-practices-and-policies/best-practices-and-policies-overview/#data-policy","title":"Data Policy","text":""},{"location":"best-practices-and-policies/best-practices-and-policies-overview/#job-scheduling-policy","title":"Job Scheduling Policy","text":""},{"location":"best-practices-and-policies/best-practices-and-policies-overview/#reservation-policy","title":"Reservation Policy","text":""},{"location":"best-practices-and-policies/best-practices-and-policies-overview/#shared-resource-policy","title":"Shared Resource Policy","text":""},{"location":"best-practices-and-policies/best-practices-and-policies-overview/#ssh-policy","title":"SSH Policy","text":""},{"location":"best-practices-and-policies/cybersecurity-policy/","title":"Cybersecurity","text":"<p>Argonne National Laboratory has an aggressive cybersecurity program, combining expert staff with hardware and software capabilities that help protect against intrusion and detect attacks.

Beyond this 100 GB limit, write-access is denied and data will need to be deleted or moved to continue writes. All home directories are initially created with owner read/write/execute privileges. Users are free to give read/execute privileges to group/world if they desire on their own home directory. Group/world write access on home directories is prohibited. LCRC is not responsible for any access granted by the user beyond the defaults set at creation time. We recommend reviewing your home directory permissions at regular intervals.</p> <p>Data files from simulations should be stored in the project space allocated to each project. Each project is allocated 1 TB of space. PIs can request additional space with proper justification to LCRC. Each application is carefully reviewed by the LCRC team to determine if additional storage space is justified. It must be emphasized that the project space is shared between all members of a project. The project PIs should ensure that individual members of the project manage their simulation data files in order to not exceed the allocated storage space. LCRC has a soft limit of 1 TB and a hard limit of 2 TB. These limits imply that the system will allow a project to exceed the nominal soft limit of 1 TB but not the hard limit of 2 TB for 14 days. These flexible storage limits allows projects to complete simulations that might require higher storage for a period of 14 days without stopping an on-going simulation. However, no further writes are allowed after the project reaches the hard limit of 2 TB or is above the 1 TB limit beyond the 14-day period.</p> <p>When LCRC moves to a new shared storage system (roughly every 5-7 years) and if you have condo storage paid for on the old system, we have a couple of options. If your existing storage amounts to less than 50 terabytes, we will move your data over to the new storage for free, and there is no future charge. Otherwise, the lifetime of your purchased storage is 5 years after we first made the space available to the group. This may overlap the new storage availability. At the end of your 5 years, and if we have changed storage systems in the interim, your space reverts to the general pool (with advanced notice).

This means, among other things, don\u2019t submit jobs that use a large number of nodes that run for a long time. If your job uses several hundred nodes, limit the run time to a few hours. Likewise, if your job runs for several hundred hours, limit the number of nodes to less than a dozen or so. We do encourage large jobs and if they need to run for awhile, this is okay.

On such nodes, the memory bandwidth and cache size per core may limit the parallel efficiency of VASP. These problems can be (partly) alleviated by using OpenMP.\" See the VASP manual for details.</p> <p>Zhao et al. found that for many VASP calculations, eight OpenMP threads per MPI process give the best performance on the Zen3 architecture.</p> <p>Improv's AMD EPYC 7713 Zen3 processor has eight core complexes (CCXs).  Each CCX has eight cores sharing a common L3 memory cache. VASP6 can exploit the fast bandwidth of these caches with openMP.  We have tested the effect of using VASP configured to use openMP on the elapsed time for a single gamma point calculation for a ferromagnetic Pt296Fe255 cluster with VASP v6.5.1 on eight Improv nodes (1024 cores).  The results are presented in the figure below.</p> <p></p> <p>Note that using four, eight, or sixteen OpenMP threads per MPI process is more than twice as fast as pure MPI (1 OpenMP thread per MPI process) for this benchmark. VASP with eight OpenMP threads per MPI process is the fastest (2.7 times faster than one OpenMP thread per MPI process). We recommend testing the effect of the number of OpenMP threads on your calculations because the speedup with threads may be different for your calculations. </p> <p>Sample scripts to run VASP 6.5.1 and VASP 6.4.3 with eight OpenMP threads on Improv can be found at /software/software/custom-built/vasp/6.5.1/mt/example and /software/software/custom-built/vasp/6.4.3/mt/example.</p>"},{"location":"using-software/software-specific-guides/conda/","title":"Using Conda in LCRC","text":"<p>Due to a change in licensing requirements, we will no longer provide modules or support for Anaconda.
