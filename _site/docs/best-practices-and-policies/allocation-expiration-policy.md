# Allocation Expiration Policy

LCRC clusters are very heavily used, so the computer time your project has been given is a valuable resource. LCRC allocations are granted at the beginning of each fiscal quarter (generally at 10AM Central on the first non-weekend or Holiday of the new quarter).

At the end of each fiscal quarter, any remaining time available in your project balances will be completely removed from your bank (excluding per user startup allocations). There is no carry over between quarters.

Fiscal quarters are divided into the following time frames:

* 1st Quarter (October 1 – December 31)
* 2nd Quarter (January 1 – March 31)
* 3rd Quarter (April 1 – June 30)
* 4th Quarter (July 1 – September 30)
